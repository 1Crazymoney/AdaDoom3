Its time to start organizing assets and entities.

Breakdown of goals:

 - Internal data struct with possibility of reading from txt file in the futur
 - Store assests ultimatly to internal global maps
     * update automatically
     * reference count
 - Map of loaded "characters" by "entity_kind"
     * arrays via disc for centralized instantiation
     * Can add or remove -- play with reference counting
