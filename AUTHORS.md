    -- GID - Generic Image Decoder --
    ---------------------------------

    Purpose:

      The Generic Image Decoder is a package for decoding a broad
      variety of image formats, from any data stream, to any kind
      of medium, be it an in-memory bitmap, a GUI object,
      some other stream, arrays of floating-point initial data
      for scientific calculations, a browser element, a device,...
      Animations are supported.

      The code is unconditionally portable, independent of the
      choice of operating system, processor, endianess and compiler.

    Image types currently supported:

      BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, TGA

    Credits:

      - André van Splunter: GIF's LZW decoder
      - Martin J. Fiedler: most of the JPEG decoder (from NanoJPEG)
      - Tom Moran: various considerations
      - Bob Sutton: contribs to BMP
